                             RRDwattsond README

If you don't know what RRDwattsond is, please visit the site:
   http://pikarinen.com/rrdwattsond/

Extra Ubuntu/Debian packages needed: libdate-calc-perl rrdtool librrds-perl 
That means rrdtool plus Date::Calc and RRDs modules for perl, if you use 
non-debian distribution.

Usually the installation procedure is very easy. Get yourself as root (sudo -s),
run install.sh, edit (or remove) the config file and start the daemon. 
Then make a cron job that generates the images and possibly uploads them to 
your website.

If you want to upload the generated images to your web site, please do 
the uploading script yourself. I don't know if you use ftp, scp, rsync 
or what so it has been left as your homework.

The installation script saves the configuration file to /etc/rrdwattsond.conf
Look at it and edit the values suitable for you. If all the defaults are
ok, you don't need the config file at all so you can remove it.

If you need to find out the serial port where Wattson is, just run command:

  dmesg |grep "FTDI USB Serial Device"

From the output you can find the serial port eg. ttyUSB0. Then the right
configuration value is /dev/ttyUSB0

The installation script installs two versions of graphing script into
/usr/local/bin directory. wattsongraph-fi.sh is in Finnish and the other 
wattsongraph-en.sh is in English respectively. You can edit the script to add
uploading in the end or change the directory if you don't use the default.
After that make a cronfile into /etc/cron.d directory for example containing
just one row:

*/5 * * * * root /usr/local/bin/wattsongraph-en.sh

RRDwattsond saves some files into it's working directory. At midnight it 
saves yesterday's stored data to a file named like energydata.YYYYMMDD 
and calculated kilowatthours into file kwh.csv that contains one row per 
day. In every row there is date in ISO-8601 format, comma and then 
kilowatthours with three decimals and a newline. You can import this 
file eg. into a spreadsheet program.

Happy graphing with your Wattson.
